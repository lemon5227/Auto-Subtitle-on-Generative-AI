# requirements.txt for Auto-Subtitle-on-Generative-AI
#
# Notes:
# - PyTorch (torch) should generally be installed using the official PyTorch instructions
#   so you can pick the correct CUDA / CPU wheel for your platform: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#   If you do not install torch separately the plain `pip install -r requirements.txt` may install a
#   CPU-only torch wheel which could be slower on GPU-capable machines.
# - ffmpeg is a system dependency (apt/brew/conda). Install via your package manager or conda-forge.
# - If you intend to use faster-whisper, ensure you have a supported GPU and the appropriate CUDA
#   toolkit + drivers; otherwise rely on the standard openai-whisper implementation.
