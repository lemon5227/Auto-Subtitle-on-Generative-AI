00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 Hey everybody, she's a information boss.

2
00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.200
 Did you know that English is a very widely spoken language in India?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.599
 In fact, whenever we do the street interviews, viewers always wonder

4
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 that why people are answering in English and modern Hindi.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.800
 So what do Indians think about this?

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000
 How they actually aware of how their accent sounds

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.600
 sets the streets of Mumbai to find out?

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.800
 If you had to take a guess what percentage of a new population can speak fluent English?

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 40%.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 40%.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.799
 Maybe.

12
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.799
 If you go into any colleges or school, no one speaks Hindi at all.

13
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.799
 It's everything related to English itself.

14
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.799
 So I think that 70 to 80% might be fluent English.

15
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.799
 English is, I think, far more important than Hindi right now for Indians.

16
00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.799
 So yeah, I think 40 to 45% around people speak fluent English.

17
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.799
 I guess around 75% of Indian people can speak English fluently.

18
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.799
 Most of them are from South India because they are like

19
00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.799
 they are much more educated than the people living in North India.

20
00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:05.799
 So that's my opinion and I am myself a South Indian.

21
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.799
 By the way, Indian English does have a particular accent.

22
00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.799
 Do you agree with that?

23
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.799
 Yeah, I think it does.

24
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.799
 It's actually proper English.

25
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.799
 So it's not accent, it's proper English, simple.

26
00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.799
 Yeah, it's pretty much, but it has nothing at any problem with Indian people as such

27
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.799
 because that is the way we talk.

28
00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.799
 So for you, it is normal, right?

29
00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.799
 Yes, it's normal.

30
00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.799
 As an Indian person, were you aware that foreigners often make fun of the Indian English accent?

31
00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.799
 Yeah, it is actually when I have not personally encountered the situation,

32
00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.799
 but my, like I have cousins who live in the US, they speak that you know you were accent of English,

33
00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.799
 but still they get judged like this person looks Indian and you know people I don't know why.

34
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.799
 It's basically racism and it's just senseless to me basically.

35
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.799
 Yes, I was, but after I went to the United States, I thought this,

36
00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.799
 for whom I'm going to show my mid-fun of their English, so it doesn't make any difference.

37
00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.800
 I think our accent is better than theirs because they, I think they are like,

38
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 not that good, it looks like they are splitting.

39
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 Sorry, sorry not offensive, it looks like they are splitting.

40
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 And I think our accent is better.

41
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
 Yeah.

42
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 No.

43
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.800
 I think they need to learn English from us.

44
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 It is like when we are then we find it funny.

45
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 It's like, I don't really care what they think.

46
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 I can speak English and I can make other people understand what I want to say that's about.

47
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.800
 I don't really care what they think.

48
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.800
 Well Indian characters like up-of from the Simpsons have perpetuated stereotyping Western culture

49
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.800
 that Indians sound funny when they speak English.

50
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 How does that make you feel?

51
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.800
 I don't know, I think it's, if you watch, I think it's funny at times,

52
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.800
 but then it really annoys you a little like, you know, you stereotyping us a little too much.

53
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 You're taking a little further.

54
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 We don't really sound like that at all times, but okay.

55
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 That is funny.

56
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 To you guys, to the foreigners, and it's not funny to anybody in India,

57
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 because that is the way we talk.

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 So, and people understand, that's the main thing.

59
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 Sometimes I feel offended, but the day exaggerated more, I think, you know,

60
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 we don't speak like that firstly, but yeah, I feel offended sometimes.

61
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800
 Very offended to be honest.

62
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.800
 I mean, it's funny for some time and like, don't know.

63
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.800
 We do not speak like that, stop doing that.

64
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 Then to you, which English accent sounds funny or weird?

65
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 Oh.

66
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 I think.

67
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 The way Russians speak, I mean, the people, those who have been language has Russian or French.

68
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.800
 They, those are the leaders, English speaking people around, seriously.

69
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.800
 My brother has been in Australia, and his accent is literally funny.

70
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.800
 For me, or Australian accent is, I really don't understand any of it.

71
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 Literally, any of, I just don't understand.

72
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.800
 Not because of the accent, maybe because of the wrong grammatical use, I find Chinese English quite funny.

73
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 Because they don't use the proper grammatical things.

74
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
 Chinese, I must say Chinese.

75
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 So, they language is different.

76
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 So, they speak in English.

77
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 Exactly.

78
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 They even don't pronounce it very well.

79
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 They're, they're, even don't open for that.

80
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 So, why does everybody speak English as opposed to the native and their languages?

81
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 In India, I guess speaking English is a trend, or maybe a, it is like show for something.

82
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.800
 I think, if you know English, you have lots of friends, and you're a cool guy.

83
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 I'll say parents, that's it.

84
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 Because they want the kids to speak English, so that when they go to the school, they don't feel ashamed.

85
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 Is that how every child is taught from an early young age?

86
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 I cannot say about other Chinese, but my father, he insisted, at my home, I should speak my own native language, and he pays good peace for my school.

87
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.800
 So, it's, schools responsibility to teach me English.

88
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 So, I don't know how does everyone works.

89
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800
 But that's how I was water.

90
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 Some people feel, actually, most of their people's people feel that when they are educated in English, they will have higher job opportunities.

91
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 And then they dream about going to other countries for jobs.

92
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 And that's the basic reason for them learning English. Otherwise, they would not even be interested in knowing the language.

93
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 So, if you speak fluent English, do people treat you better?

94
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 Yeah, in India, yes. I have seen that.

95
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 Yeah, I guess so, when you just come across someone, you have a sort of mindset towards them.

96
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800
 As soon as they start speaking, your mindset changes.

97
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 They can speak English, yeah, they must feel like, who will I guess?

98
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 And if you're talking before a girl, she is going to win press value. That's the most important thing about talking English.

99
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:19.800
 When you start talking in English and especially when you're talking really fluent here, they will just, they give you much more respect than they usually give to other people who are talking in other languages.

100
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.800
 Because English is becoming such a dominant language in Indian society, are you ever concerned that traditional Indian languages might disappear?

101
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 Yes, it is going on right now. I think even a academy today's generation is taught to speak in English and right English.

102
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:45.800
 Yes, I am afraid of that thing right now because we being the youth of India, we shall take care of this thing that we should not forget our own native language.

103
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.800
 If this continues, perhaps if that day is not for this, this will be our national language.

104
00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:01.800
 No, I'm not quite concerned about it because we often have many organizations and cultural committees who focus on other languages.

105
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.800
 So I don't think it is dying out because there are many people who support it and they want our traditional languages to last forever.

106
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:18.800
 Yeah, I'm bit concerned because as I said before, it is like when a child is born, they are taught English first and then the mother tongue.

107
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 So this is not a good thing for me.

108
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.800
 Like even now we are speaking about English, we are not discussing any other language here.

109
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.800
 So that itself shows how we give English more importance than any other languages.

110
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.800
 So if this disappear, the regional languages, what would that mean for the next generation of Indians growing up?

111
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:51.800
 Well, it would be really bad. I think people from other countries come to India to see the culture and everything and we might just lose it on the way.

112
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.800
 So I just hope we don't really, but I don't think it would really go anywhere.

113
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.800
 We will continue speaking Hindi, Marathi and everything.

114
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:08.800
 Learn to speak language language is really important but do not forget you come from society or group of people or give them a community.

115
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800
 Don't forget that. Don't forget your roots.

116
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800
 Well, there you have it guys.

117
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.800
 This English becoming dominant language in your country and how is it affecting your community?
