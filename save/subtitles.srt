00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
 What is Generative Artificial Intelligence or Generative AI?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,800
 Generative AI is an artificial intelligence technology that can create new content in text,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
 image, music and video forms.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,200
 Businesses are exceptionally excited by the possibilities of specialised Generative AI models,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,600
 because they can be trained on an organization's own corporate data.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,800
 And they can collaborate with knowledge workers to dramatically boost productivity.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,200
 Estimates value the productivity boost that up to 8 trillion dollars a year to the global economy.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,680
 An example of Generative AI is chat box which are taken a worldwide storm.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,960
 Thanks to their ability to write human-like conversational text.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,960
 They can express complex ideas synthesised from the vast venues of information on which they are trained.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,880
 In business, they can help writer improve emails and presentations help ideate new marketing campaigns and much more.

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,400
 Generative AI relies on machine learning models that mimic human neural networks.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
 A concept that dates back to early AI research.

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,000
 Critical algorithms emerged in the 1980s that advanced the science.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,160
 And in the last few years, new training algorithms.

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,400
 The availability of purpose-built processing UX, for example, GPUs which provide massively parallel processing

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
 and refinements in training data sets, these have all led to the systems that we use today.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,200
 The result is Generative AI models that appear to create, surprisingly like humans do.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,920
 Innovation in Generative AI is accelerating at breathtakingly fast speed,

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,880
 as businesses all over the world experiment with it.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
 While entrepreneurs and investors launch new business ideas to build upon it.

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,760
 Generative AI has launched a new era in technology that promises both greater productivity

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,760
 and new ways to solve business problems that simply weren't previously possible.
